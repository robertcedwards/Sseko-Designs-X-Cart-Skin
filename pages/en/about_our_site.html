	Sseko sandals are in standard American sizes. If you are unsure of what size to order, <strong>measure a pair of your own sandals </strong>(not your feet!)&nbsp;and use the size chart below to help you decide! Choose a pair of sandals that you like the fit of and that have a flat base. &nbsp;{Remember flip flops are typically longer/bigger than fashion sandals.} The measurements are in centimeters and are taken from the tip of the sole (toe) to the lowest point of the sole&#39;s heel (a slight diagonal.)</p>
